Loops: 


1. For Loop
for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    console.log(i);
}


2. While Loop
3. Do-while Loop 
4. For...of Loop
5. For..in Loop


Infinite loop: That is a loop never stops due to a logical mistake and termination point is never met.

for(; ;){
    // Infinite loop
}



i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0              =>              i % 15 === 0
